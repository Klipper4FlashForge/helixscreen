/**
 * @brief Loopback HTTP server standing in for Moonraker's file endpoints under --test
 *
 * The mock MoonrakerClient answers WebSocket RPC, but thumbnails do not arrive
 * that way: `MoonrakerFileTransferAPI::download_thumbnail()` issues a real
 * `requests::get()` against the configured HTTP base URL, on an HttpExecutor
 * worker. With nothing listening, `--test` never downloads, decodes or
 * pre-scales a thumbnail — so the entire cold-fetch pipeline (download →
 * stb_image decode → resize → `.bin` write → cache eviction) was unreachable
 * outside a live printer.
 *
 * That gap is why the #960 heap-corruption hunt could not be pursued under a
 * sanitizer: the instrumented app exercised the UI half and never touched the
 * half the crash bundle implicated. Stubbing the transfer API would not have
 * closed it either — the point is to keep the real HTTP client, the real worker
 * threads and the real decode running, and only replace the server.
 *
 * Binds 127.0.0.1 on an ephemeral port so parallel instances (worktrees, test
 * shards) never collide. `--test` only; nothing here is compiled into a
 * production build.

/// state, so an unload that finishes between two syncs publishes IDLE->IDLE and
/// notifies nobody (prestonbrown/helixscreen#1512). Backends also end an unload
/// on an action other than UNLOADING — a K2 Plus ends it CUTTING->IDLE — which
/// no single edge predicate covers.
///
/// The wake feed is ams_data_revision, bumped after every backend-event sync
/// and therefore always notifying. It is armed when the chain starts and torn
/// down when the chain settles (lane clear enables, ERROR disarms) or is
/// cancelled — a settled controller stays detached.

/**
 * @file wifi_interface.h
 * @brief Resolve ONE coherent WiFi identity instead of three separate guesses.
 *
 * Before this existed, the wpa_supplicant backend made three uncorrelated
 * first-match guesses: the netdev (first /sys/class/net/wlan* with a wireless/
 * dir), the control socket (first entry in the ctrl dir), and the config path
 * (first wpa_supplicant in /proc). On an Adventurer 5M they disagreed — the
 * backend logged "Found WiFi interface: wlan1" one line before "Found
 * wpa_supplicant socket: /run/wpa_supplicant/wlan0" (bundles 9GQXV5VN,
 * 9F9EF5VP, v0.99.106).
 *
 * Resolution starts from the control socket that actually answers STATUS,
 * because that is the only one of the three we can verify, and derives the rest
 * from it.

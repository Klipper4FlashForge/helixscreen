/**
 * @brief Pure state machine deciding when a periodic WiFi scan should fire.
 *
 * Owns no timer, does no I/O, and never touches LVGL — it only answers
 * "should the next tick actually trigger a scan?" and "how long should the
 * next tick wait?". The caller (WiFiManager) owns the lv_timer_t and is the
 * only thing that calls trigger_scan() / lv_timer_set_period().
 *
 * Policy:
 * - No overlap: a scan already in flight suppresses should_trigger() until
 *   on_scan_complete() reports it done.
 * - Backoff: each time a scan reports the same result count as the previous
 *   scan, the interval grows by kBaseIntervalMs (capped at kMaxIntervalMs).
 *   A changed count snaps the interval back to kBaseIntervalMs.
 * - Suppression: once the result count has been unchanged for two
 *   consecutive scans while connected, scanning is suppressed entirely
 *   (should_trigger() stays false) until a manual refresh or a disconnect.
 *   This is the case that matters most: a single-radio station sitting on
 *   the network settings page, already connected, whose scan results have
 *   stopped changing — there is nothing left to learn by continuing to
 *   knock the radio off-channel every few seconds.

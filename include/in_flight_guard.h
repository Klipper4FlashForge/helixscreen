/**
 * @file in_flight_guard.h
 * @brief Single-flight guard for async RPCs with a stuck-response self-heal.
 *
 * Several panels gate an async Moonraker RPC behind an "in-flight" bool that is
 * cleared only in the success/error callback. If the response is silently lost
 * (WebSocket drop, server never replies), the flag wedges forever and the panel
 * stops refreshing. This helper folds that pattern — the boolean plus an optional
 * timestamp-based self-heal — into one place so every caller gets the same
 * behavior (extracted from PrintSelectPanel's refresh_should_skip(), #910/#911).
 *
 * @c now is injectable so unit tests drive stuck-detection deterministically.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: acquire on the main thread, release from a callback that has
 * already been marshalled back to the main thread (the panels do this via
 * tok.defer / queue_update).

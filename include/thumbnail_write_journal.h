/**
 * @file thumbnail_write_journal.h
 * @brief One-way write notifications from ThumbnailProcessor to ThumbnailCache
 *
 * ThumbnailCache keeps an in-memory index of its directory so eviction does not
 * stat every file on every fetch (prestonbrown/helixscreen#1207). The index is
 * only honest if it learns about every byte in that directory — and
 * ThumbnailProcessor writes the pre-scaled `.bin` files there, holding no
 * reference to the cache and reporting to nobody.
 *
 * That is not a small leak. On the card path every thumbnail becomes a `.bin`
 * several times the size of its source PNG, so an index blind to them
 * under-counts by most of the cache. An under-counting cache reads as "well
 * under the limit" and stops evicting entirely — the same silent failure mode
 * b0db2b957 fixed when a bad directory entry truncated the scan.
 *
 * This class is the seam. The processor drops a path in; the cache picks it up
 * on its next accounting pass and pays one `stat` for it, rather than a walk of
 * the whole directory.
 *
 * ## Why a journal rather than a direct call
 *
 * It is deliberately dumb: it records strings under its own mutex and never
 * calls back into anything. That mutex is therefore a leaf — it can never
 * participate in a cycle with `ThumbnailCache::mutex_` or
 * `ThumbnailProcessor::mutex_`, both of which are held on multiple threads.
 * A processor worker calling `ThumbnailCache` directly would have to take the
 * cache's eviction lock from inside a pool task, which is exactly the kind of
 * cross-subsystem lock order this code has already been bitten by.
 *
 * Lifetime is handled by the cache owning the journal via `shared_ptr` while
 * the processor holds only a `weak_ptr`, so a destroyed cache leaves no
 * dangling reference and in-flight writes simply find nobody listening.
 *
 * Thread-safe: every method may be called from any thread.

/**
 * @file test_thumbnail_cache_main_thread_delivery.cpp
 * @brief ThumbnailCache callbacks always land on the LVGL main thread (#960, #1202).
 *
 * Callers hand ThumbnailCache callbacks that set LVGL image sources, but which
 * thread a result arrived on used to depend on which internal path produced it.
 * #1202 identified the download callbacks; it closed with the mutex half and
 * left the marshalling half open. Two of the four paths are non-obvious:
 *
 *   - `fetch_optimized()`'s download ERROR fires on an HttpExecutor worker,
 *     while its download SUCCESS is already safe (it routes through
 *     ThumbnailProcessor::deliver_result, which queue_update()s).
 *   - ThumbnailProcessor's shutdown branches report `on_error` unmarshalled on
 *     the calling thread, and `process_and_callback` converts that into a
 *     *success* via the PNG fallback — so even a success could be delivered on
 *     a worker.
 *
 * Both entry points therefore wrap the caller's callbacks once, at the
 * boundary. These tests pin both halves of that contract: a background caller
 * is marshalled, and a main-thread caller still gets the synchronous delivery
 * it has today (a pre-scaled cache hit must not slip a frame).
 *
 * The null-api error path is used deliberately as the probe: it reaches the
 * callback with no HTTP, no filesystem state and no worker pool, so the test is
 * deterministic and fast while still exercising the real wrapper.

/**
 * @file test_recovery_dialog_threading.cpp
 * @brief show_recovery_for() must not touch UI state on the caller's thread.
 *
 * Its callers are background threads: MoonrakerClient's event handler runs on
 * the libhv event loop (KLIPPY_DISCONNECTED / KLIPPY_SHUTDOWN), and
 * AbortManager reaches it the same way — abort_manager.cpp even documents
 * relying on it to defer for them.
 *
 * Dialog *creation* was always deferred. What was not: the preamble read and
 * wrote recovery_dialog_ and recovery_reason_ and queried ModalStack directly
 * on the calling thread, racing the main thread doing the same during teardown.
 *
 * Asserting "a dialog appeared" cannot catch that — it appears either way,
 * because the inner hop was always there. recovery_reason_ is the discriminator:
 * it must still be untouched when the background call returns, and settle only
 * once the queue drains.
 *
 * This test is only meaningful because ui_emergency_stop.o is now linked into
 * the test binary. It previously was not: mk/tests.mk filtered it out and
 * ui_test_utils.cpp supplied a hand-written copy, so anything asserted here
 * validated the copy instead of the shipped code.

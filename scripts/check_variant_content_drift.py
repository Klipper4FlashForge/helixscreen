"""Warn when a staged change touches CONTENT in one half of a layout-variant
pair but not the other.

check_variant_parity.py compares WIRING between a ui_xml/<variant>/ override
and its base — widget name=, subject bindings, event callbacks, <api> props —
and deliberately not attributes, because reflow is the entire point of a
variant (see that script's docstring). That leaves a gap: bump a font, swap an
icon src=, or edit a translation_tag= in the base and forget the variant, and
every existing gate passes silently. The two screens slowly stop saying the
same thing.

This gate closes that gap for exactly three CONTENT-bearing attributes:

    src=              icon / image name
    text=             literal on-screen text
    translation_tag=  the word actually shown, via the translation table

Layout attributes (width, height, align, flex_*, style_*, pad_*, ...) are
deliberately not in that list and must never trip this gate — reflowing a
panel between breakpoints is the entire reason a variant file exists.

It is scoped to the STAGED diff, not the working tree: a file changed but not
staged is not about to be committed, and a base+variant pair staged TOGETHER is
the correct, silent case (the human already kept them in sync). Only when
exactly one half of a pair is staged, and that staged diff touches one of the
three attributes above, does it warn.

It is also scoped to WARN, never fail: additive divergence is legitimate and
already present in the tree — ui_xml/portrait/print_status_panel.xml carries a
whole temperature section the base does not, because portrait has room for it
and landscape doesn't. A hard gate cannot tell that apart from rot; a human
glancing at the file name and attribute can.

Known false-positive shape: this reads the staged diff *line by line*
(`git diff --cached -U0`), not attribute by attribute. If a changed layout
attribute shares a line with an untouched content attribute — both live on the
same unwrapped XML element — the line as a whole still counts as touching that
attribute. Word-level diffing would close this, but the gate is warn-only by
design, so an occasional over-warn costs a glance, not a broken build; the
line-level version stays simple and never has a false SILENCE, which is the
failure mode that would actually matter.

Usage:
    ./scripts/check_variant_content_drift.py

Reads `git diff --cached` in the current repo — run it from a checkout, not
with file arguments.

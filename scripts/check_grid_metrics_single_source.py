"""Fail if grid_edit_mode.cpp grows a second cell-geometry computation.

GridEditMode::current_metrics() is the one place allowed to ask GridLayout for
the grid's dimensions; every other path takes a CellMetrics from it instead of
calling GridLayout directly, so gutter handling and int-vs-float rounding can't
drift between call sites.

Counting is per LINE, not per call: two matches on one source line register as
one hit. This is exactly why current_metrics() puts get_cols() and get_rows()
on separate lines — folding them onto one line would consume only one of
LIMIT's two slots and leave a free slot for a future duplicate elsewhere in
the file. Keep them on separate lines.

The pattern matches static `GridLayout::get_*` calls only. It does not see the
instance accessors (`GridLayout temp_grid(bp); temp_grid.cols();`) — five
`GridLayout temp_grid(...)` sites already exist in this file and are outside
this gate's reach. That's a known gap, not a bug; widening the pattern to
cover instance calls is future work, not this gate's job today.
